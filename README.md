# Longest Increasing Subsequence (LIS)

This repository contains two solutions to the Longest Increasing Subsequence (LIS) problem, implemented in Python. The LIS problem consists of finding the longest subsequence in a given sequence such that all elements of the subsequence are sorted in increasing order.

## Files

- `DPsolution.py`: This file contains a dynamic programming solution to the LIS problem.
- `BottomUp.py`: This file contains a bottom-up dynamic programming solution to the LIS problem.
